If the investigations in the case of sec -\\ntion 138 subsection (3) do not confirm the suspicion, the parties called on to conduct the \\ninvestigation shall be reimbursed for the costs if they are not responsible for the circum\\n-\\nstances that gave rise to the suspicion. In cases falling under section 144 subsection (1) \\nno. 2 and 3, the costs shall be met by the party that could have been required to draw up a \\nremediation plan. \\n \\n(2) Several responsible parties shall have a claim for compensation regardless of their \\nrelationship inter se. Unless otherwise agreed, the extent of the compensation to be paid \\nshall be governed by the degree to which the situation giving rise to the remediation obliga -\\ntion can be attributed to the individual obliged parties; section 426 subsection (1), second \\nsentence, of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) shall apply mutatis mutandis. The \\ncompensation claim shall lapse in three years; sections 438, 548 and 606 of the Civil Code \\nshall not apply. The limitation period shall start after the recovery of costs if an authority car\\n-\\nries out measures itself, otherwise after the measures are completed by the party responsi -\\nble, as per the date on which the party becomes aware of the person from whom compensa -\\ntion is owed.
